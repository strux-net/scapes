./ftrace -invalid
Unknown option: invalid
usage : ftrace [options] [ -- strace-options ] [ command [ args ] ]

trace a process (and it's childs) and produces a tree-view summary.

Example :
  ftrace -p 33445
  ftrace apt-get install whatever

If the command contains options you need to stop the option-parsing of ftrace
  ftrace -- rsync -a /this /there

For -p to work you need
  either
    echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
  or
    vi /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf
Notes : 
  ftrace does not trace suid-programs (unless you are root).
    Even a (at first glance) harmless ping is such a candidate.
    consider this when tracing scripts.
  when attaching to a running process (with -p) there is a small time-window, where ftrace may get confused.
    ftrace has to figure out what the current cwd of the process to be attached is.
    then ftrace attaches to this process.
    If between these two steps the cwd of the process changes, then some (or all) paths may be wrong.
  You will most likely never need to set strace-options.
    ftrace will provide the needed options automatically
  It can also parse exiting trace-files
    the trace file should be produced with
      strace -q -f -ttt -o strace.out -- yourCommandHere
    run ftrace
      ftrace -f strace.out 
  The strux-tools contain a syntax-file for viewing the tree with vim.
    in a vim-buffer with the output of ftrace do
      :set ft=ftrace
Bugs : 
  Probably some
OPTIONS:
  -p:<pid>	a pid to trace
  -fno	file names only
  -q	quiet (don't print header)
  -s	give information about bytes written to stdout and stderr
  -v	verbose (tell the flags used for file actions)
  -i:<regexp>	do not report files matching the given regexp
	default for <regexp> is /dev/
  -f:<file>	do not trace anything but parse an existing strace-file
  -fd:<dir>	for -f tell in what dir the trace was created
	default for <dir> is /unknown/
  -oa:<file>	append output to the given file
  -o:<file>	write output to the given file
  -Pp	preprend the pid in the output
  -version	show version information
