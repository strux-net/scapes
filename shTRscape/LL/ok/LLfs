usage : LLfs [<file>]
opens a powerful directory-browser (fail-save).

file can be a directory or a path to a real file.
  in the latter case the cursor is positioned on the corresponding entry.
If no file is given, then the current dir is used.

You must have vim7 (or later) installed.
Note:
  LL does the same but uses your .vimrc and plugins (and may fail for this reason).
OPTIONS:
  -version	show version information
