usage : LL [<file>]
opens a powerful directory-browser.

file can be a directory or a path to a real file.
  in the latter case the cursor is positioned on the corresponding entry.
If no file is given, then the current dir is used.

You must have vim7 (or later) installed.
Note:
  This may fail if you have a vim-setup that interferes with this LL.
  In this case try LLfs (the fail-save version of LL). 
  LLfs does the same but does not use  your .vimrc and plugins.
OPTIONS:
  -version	show version information
EOU
  exit 1
