USAGE
	Testprogram for actioncall in in-action.

	In the in-action of item call first and second

	Basically:
	  item
	    >>first
	    >>second

	take a closer look at -item
	  Suppose it is run for this in-file
		1
		  1.1
		    1.1.1
	  $NrOfLinesFollowing for -item is 3. Hence you find 3 occurences of item in the second column .
	  since second and first are already closed (out-action is performed) when -item is performed their outactions count for $NrOfLinesFollowing.
	  subitem is seen in -second -first -item -line

	Details:
	  the depthactions are in the following order
	    < item
	    < first
	    < second
	  the outactions are in the following order
	    < second
	    < first
	    < item
	  $NrOfLinesFollowing in item contains the lines produced by first, second (as well as what item produces)
	  $NrOfLinesFollowing in first contains the lines produced by second (as well as what item produces)
	  $NrOfLinesFollowing in first contains the lines item produces
