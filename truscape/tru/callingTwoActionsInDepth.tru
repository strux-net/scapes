USAGE
	Testprogram for actioncall in depth-action.

	In the depth-action of item call first and second

	Basically:
	  item
	  |-
	    >>first
	    >>second

	take a closer look at -item
	  Suppose it is run for this in-file
		1
		  1.1
		    1.1.1
	  $NrOfLinesFollowing for -first is 6. Hence you find 6 occurences of first in the second column .
	Details:
	  depthaction(first) directly follows inaction(first)
	    > first
	    - first
	    it does not follow the depthaction(line), as you might expect
	    same for second

	    \$NrOfLinesFollowing in depthaction(first) and outaction(first) includes all lines produced after the ">> first" in depthaction(line)
	      In the example:
	        $NrOfLinesFollowing is 8
	        index 5-12
	          note : the outaction of second is also included
	    \$NrOfLinesFollowing in depthaction(second) and outaction(second) includes all lines produced after the ">> second" in depthaction(line)
	      In the example:
	        $NrOfLinesFollowing is 4
	        index 8-11
	  the outactions are in the following order
	    < second
	    < first
	    < line
