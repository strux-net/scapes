VERSION	3.0
USAGE
	How to read the truer :
	  The truer is very simple.
	  Each output-statement consists of two fields
	    action	pit
	  where
	    field			meaning
	    -----			-------
	    action			indication of what (sub)action is called
	    pit				Point in Time (see below)

	How to read the output :
	  The output lines consist of 5 fields
	    seq	action	pit	$NrOfLinesFollowing	$_
	  where
	    field			meaning
	    -----			-------
	    seq				sequence number (see below)
	    action			indication of what (sub)action is called
	    pit				Point in Time (see below)
	    $NrOfLinesFollowing		empty if zero
	    $_				obvious

	seq
	  the chronological-sequence in which the lines are produced.
	  A line with sequence-nr 5 is the 5th line produced.
	pit
	  the depth-actions (and out-actions) in which this line counts for $NrOfLinesFollowing.
	  entries are in chronological order. (Who sees them when)
	  underscore (_) means : seen in no action.
	  the number of times an action occurs in the second column corresponds to $NrOfLinesFollowing.

	It is suitable to be run with ~/tru/tru/unroll.tru.

	Details (common to all cases)
	  Suppose it is run for this in-file
		1
		  1.1
		    1.1.1
	  The call produces a block the following eight lines
	    >first
	    -first
	    moreText1
	    >second
	    -second
	    moreText2
	      see Note below
	    <second
	    <first
	  Note:
	    after moreText2
	      test7s1 (in)
		-item
		  subitem
	      test7s2 (depth)
		  subitem
	      test7s3 (out)
	        nothing
