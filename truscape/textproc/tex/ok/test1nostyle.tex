introducing a verbatim part
\begin{verbatim}

        can start with a blank line
must start at or after the next tab-position
  can continue with any blanks, eg. one
    or three
can contain	tabs
  1	one
  22	twenty two
  333	threehundredandthirtythree
but tabhandling is poor with tex_tru

can contain blank lines (one before and two to follow)

\end{itemize}
An autotable can jump to next page (since supertabular) with tex\_tru if in pre-mode and \$LD is $\backslash$$\backslash$$\backslash$$\backslash$. This is very annoying.
But since I changed $\backslash$$\backslash$$\backslash$$\backslash$ to $\backslash$n this phenomenon is not longer there. Smile.
