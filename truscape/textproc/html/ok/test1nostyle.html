but tabhandling is poor with tex_tru

can contain blank lines (one before and two to follow)

An autotable within a list

  <td>autotableline</td>

</ul>
An autotable can jump to next page (since supertabular) with tex_tru if in pre-mode and $LD is \\\\. This is very annoying.
But since I changed \\\\ to \n this phenomenon is not longer there. Smile.
