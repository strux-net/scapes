  3rd section
    subsubsection
      paragraph
        subparagraph
	      A table	at a deep indent
	      with	2 lines
	  subparagraph1 too deep
	    subparagraph2 too deep
	      tex cannot handle this deeply nests
  4th section
    introducing a verbatim part
    verbatim

	        can start with a blank line
	must start at or after the next tab-position
	  can continue with any blanks, eg. one
	    or three
	can contain	tabs
	  1	one
	  22	twenty two
	  333	threehundredandthirtythree
	but tabhandling is poor with tex_tru

	can contain blank lines (one before and two to follow)


3rd Chapter
  An autotable within a list
      1st autolistline
        is extended
      2nd autolistline
          1st	autotableline
	  2nd	autotableline
      3rd autolistline
  An autotable can jump to next page (since supertabular) with tex_tru if in pre-mode and $LD is \\\\. This is very annoying.
  But since I changed \\\\ to \n this phenomenon is not longer there. Smile.
