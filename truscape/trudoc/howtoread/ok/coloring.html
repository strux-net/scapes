<h1>How to read the coloring.</h1>
<div>
Lines are split at tabs into fields.<br/>
The fields are colored differently so that you have a clear indication of whether the white-space between the fields is one or more tabs rather than spaces.<br/>
Since tabs are a very important concept for truers, you should use an editor that is able to indicate them.<br/>
